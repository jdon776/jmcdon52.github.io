        I, <em>Joshua K. McDonald</em>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2026, ITIS3135,
        Front End Web Development
        class with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly
        available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is
        inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that
        counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show
        as absences. I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many
        examples online or even view my classmates' code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to
        learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries)
        and never from my classmates.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Signed:</strong> <em>Joshua K. McDonald</em> , 01/25/2026</p>
