    <p>I am a senior who transferred from UNCC to CPCC, then back to UNCC! I`m finishing up my degree in Computer
        Science with a concentration in mobile app development and software engineering.</p>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Personal Background: </strong> I am 26 years old with a massive fascination for anything regarding technology and software! I love video games and spend a lot of time talking about them.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Background: </strong>No computer science background, but tons of customer service, food service experience. </li>
        <li><strong>Academic Background: </strong>Attended UNCC in 2022, transferred to CPCC in 2025, came back to UNCC this semester.</li>
        <li><strong>Background in this Subject: </strong>I've made a couple, albeit not great looking, websites for fun.</li>
        <li><strong>Primary Work Computer: </strong> I mainly work off of a $250 HP laptop that I got in 2021. It has never failed me!</li>
        <li><strong>Backup Work Computer & Location Plan: </strong> As much as I love UNCC’s library, I plan to go to the public library by the university if all else fails.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Current Courses:</strong> </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>ITIS 3310 - Software Architecture & Design:</strong> Software architecture is much more complex than I thought, and it’s required.</li>
        <li><strong>ITIS 3135 - Front End Web Development:</strong>Front end development is a great starting point for anyone. </li>
        <li><strong>STAT 2122 - Intro to Probability & Statistics: </strong> Required course but stats has always been interesting to me, too.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> I’m left-handed, so please don't look at me strangely if I open a door weirdly or hold an item in an odd way.</p>
